# Local Student Course Selection System

A toy project to practice some React.js functions after I learned something like how to make a todo list.

This is [Demo](https://iris1e27.github.io/local-student-course-selection-system/pages/index.html).

We use MVC in this project.

Just like a to-do list in the browser, you should clear your data if you don't need it to save space.

For example, in the chrome browser, F12->Application->clear IndexedDB and Local Storage.

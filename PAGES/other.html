        <h2>What I think after writing the whole piece</h2>
        <p class="text">
          I think my work is almost good, since I knew nothing about JS two weeks
          ago. Since then, I only knew a little about HTML CSS and VB events. Haha! However, I did all things done in just 2 weeks. In this period, I
          learned open-source codes written by Tania Rascia. Then, FYP tutor told me that Flutter could be a better one to create an app. I learned Flutter for one day. Then, I started learning React. Cool! 
          After struggling with React for a few days, I knew how to write codes to control view layer and handle events. Then, I learned IndexedDB in mdn web docs. Thanks for the detailed tutorials! 
          When I got closer to the end, I found a big problem about undefined. But the truth is I write "type" but the correct one is "typeof". If I did not ask for my friend, I never know my mind blind. 
          Thanks for his careful correction anyway. This is the end, and today is May 1st 2020. Happy labour's holidy to you all!

        <h2>What are the weaknesses in this system</h2>
        <p class="text">
          1. A lot of functions instead of objects, so it is high coupling maybe. How to rewrite them by OOP design? 
          2. I don't know why if I bind all the functions in student.js, there will be an error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'dataset'). Why that will happen? 
          3. If administrator deletes a selected course from the database, students' Interface will not be changed until you click the cancel button. Or, how to make them update simultaneously? 
          4. Administrator can clear the add a course input (innerHTML), but there is still value for that field (value={}). 
          5. Administrator can update a course, but although the inputs seem to have values (innerHTML), you still need to check them (onBlur) to give them true values (value={}). 
        </p>

        <h2>What is my introspection</h2>
        <p class="text">
          1. I didn't design this whole system very well, specially in the database part. I think this is my knowledge limitations.
          2. I still need to dive in web application and know more deep insights, such as HTML CSS React.js.
          3. There is no way for you to continue being a novice, so you need to test more to find how to update it.
